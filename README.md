# PersonalTweets-LocalStorage

In this project, I read the tweets from a HTML Form  and Inputs and save it into LocalStorage, so that even if we close the tab or reload the window the saved information is still going to be there.

Well, Thanks to this amazing JavaScript feature

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

You need to clone this repository via SSH or HTTPS link provided by GitHub using terminal :
```
git clone git@github.com:nehasadhvi/PersonalTweets-LocalStorage.git
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/nehasadhvi/PersonalTweets-LocalStorage.git
```

Now, after succesfully cloning the repo, to run the application on your local computer you need to open the local repo using VS Code(highly recommended) and use the "Live Server" extention to run the application on pre-defined port by live server.

This will make your application run on PORT 5500, if in use, on next available port.

Happy Tweeting ! ;)

### Prerequisites

You will need to have an VS Code, Sublime Text or any other IDE of your choice installed on your OS. I prefer VS Code, so you can install it from here:
